# ORBIT Loyalty & Incentive Program

**Effective Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Strategy:** Reward reliability, share profits, keep overhead lean  
**Competitive Advantage:** Nobody else does this

---

## 1. The Philosophy

**Traditional Staffing Model:**
- Offer PTO to everyone
- Fixed costs whether you're profitable or not
- Workers don't feel "ownership" in success
- Turnover is high (workers move to next agency)

**ORBIT Loyalty Model:**
- Pay for reliability, not just hours
- Bonus only if you're profitable
- Workers invested in company success
- Creates "family" culture of loyal workers
- Lean overhead (3-4 people running everything)

**The Result:**
- Best workers stay (because bonuses reward them)
- Worst workers leave (no incentive to stay)
- Your cost is variable (bonuses only when profitable)
- Workers feel they share in success
- Totally different from competitors

---

## 2. The Program Structure

### 2.1 Core Metric: Availability Score

Every worker gets an **Availability Score** calculated monthly:

```
Availability Score = (Accepted Shifts / Offered Shifts) × 100

Example:
- Offered 10 shifts in month
- Worker accepted 9 shifts
- Availability Score: 90%

Or:

- Offered 20 shifts in month
- Worker accepted 20 shifts
- Availability Score: 100%
```

**ORBIT calculates this automatically:**
- Tracks all shifts offered to worker
- Tracks all shifts worker accepted
- Calculates score monthly
- Shows worker their score in app

### 2.2 Reliability Score

Beyond just accepting, we also track **Reliability:**

```
Reliability Score = (Completed Shifts / Accepted Shifts) × 100

Example:
- Worker accepted 10 shifts
- Worker completed 9 shifts (1 no-show)
- Reliability Score: 90%

Or:

- Worker accepted 10 shifts
- Worker completed all 10 shifts
- Reliability Score: 100%
```

**Factors:**
- No-shows: Major negative impact
- Tardies: Minor negative impact (-5% per tardy)
- Early clock-outs: Small negative impact
- Perfect completion: 100%

### 2.3 Loyalty Score (Combined)

```
Loyalty Score = (Availability × 0.6) + (Reliability × 0.4)

Example:
- Availability: 95%
- Reliability: 98%
- Loyalty Score: (95 × 0.6) + (98 × 0.4) = 57 + 39.2 = 96.2%

Or:

- Availability: 100%
- Reliability: 100%
- Loyalty Score: 100%
```

**Why this formula:**
- 60% weight on accepting available shifts (you control this)
- 40% weight on showing up (reliability matters)
- Combined: Overall worker value to the company

---

## 3. Bonus Tiers & Payouts

Workers earn **Annual Bonus** based on **12-month rolling Loyalty Score**:

### Tier 1: 90-94% Loyalty Score
```
Bonus: 2 days paid time off (or equivalent cash bonus)
Payout: $480-800 (typical)
Criteria: Consistently available, minor infractions
Example: Shows up 90% of time, occasionally late
```

### Tier 2: 95-97% Loyalty Score
```
Bonus: 5 days paid time off (or equivalent cash bonus)
Payout: $1,200-2,000 (typical)
Criteria: Very reliable, very available
Example: Shows up 95%+ of the time, almost never late
```

### Tier 3: 98-99% Loyalty Score
```
Bonus: 1 week paid time off (or equivalent cash bonus)
Payout: $2,400-4,000 (typical)
Criteria: Exceptional loyalty and reliability
Example: Shows up 99% of the time, always on time
```

### Tier 4: 100% Loyalty Score
```
Bonus: 1 week paid time off + special recognition
Payout: $2,400-5,000 + recognition award
Criteria: Perfect score for full year
Example: Zero absences, zero tardies, accepts all offered shifts
```

**Payout amounts based on:**
- Average hourly rate of worker
- Number of hours worked that year
- Regional wage variations

**Examples:**

| Hourly Rate | Hours/Year | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $18/hr | 1,500 | $480 | $1,200 | $2,400 | $3,000 |
| $22/hr | 1,500 | $586 | $1,466 | $2,932 | $3,665 |
| $28/hr | 1,500 | $746 | $1,866 | $3,732 | $4,665 |

## 4. How It Works (Month by Month)

### Month 1:
```
Worker receives shifts schedule
ORBIT shows: "You've been offered 16 shifts this month"
Worker accepts 15 shifts
Availability: 93%

Worker completes 14 of 15 shifts (1 no-show)
Reliability: 93%

Loyalty Score: (93 × 0.6) + (93 × 0.4) = 93%

No bonus yet (need 12-month history)
```

### Months 2-11:
```
Same tracking each month
Scores accumulate
Worker sees dashboard showing:
- Availability trend: 93% → 94% → 95% → 96%...
- Reliability trend: 93% → 95% → 96% → 97%...
- Overall Loyalty Score trending toward Tier 3
```

### Month 12 (Annual Review):
```
Calculate 12-month rolling average:
- Avg Availability: 96%
- Avg Reliability: 97%
- Loyalty Score: (96 × 0.6) + (97 × 0.4) = 96.8%

Result: TIER 2 (95-97%)
Bonus: $1,200-2,000

Worker receives bonus payout + notification:
"You earned $1,500 loyalty bonus for exceptional reliability"
```

### Year 2+:
```
Same calculation rolls forward
Every month, oldest month drops off
Always 12-month rolling calculation
Worker can move between tiers
Bonus recalculated annually
```

---

## 5. Payment Options

Workers can choose how to receive their bonus:

### Option A: Lump Sum Cash Payment
```
- Calculated once per year (e.g., January)
- Paid via direct deposit
- Taxed as regular income
- Worker can spend however they want
Example: Earn $2,000 bonus on January 1st
```

### Option B: Time Off (Paid Days)
```
- Convert cash value to paid days off
- Worker takes days whenever they want (with notice)
- Gets paid full hourly rate for those days
- Days don't roll over (use it or lose it policy)
Example: $2,000 bonus = 4 days paid time off at $500/day
```

### Option C: Hybrid
```
- Take partial cash, partial time off
- Example: $1,200 cash + 1 day off
- Mix and match at worker's preference
- Set once per year
```

## 6. Why This Wins

### For Workers:
```
✅ Compensation directly tied to their behavior
✅ Incentivizes showing up (more money if they do)
✅ Feels fair (best workers get most)
✅ "Free money" if they're already doing their job
✅ Shares in company success (bonus only if profitable)
✅ Clear visibility (can see score in app anytime)
✅ Different from competitors (most don't do this)
```

### For You (Agency Owner):
```
✅ Attracts best workers (loyalty program is rare)
✅ Retains best workers (once they earn bonuses, they stay)
✅ Reduces turnover costs (finding new workers is expensive)
✅ Variable cost (bonuses only if profitable)
✅ Keeps overhead lean (3-4 admins manage 100-1000 workers)
✅ Aligns incentives (they want to work, you need workers)
✅ Easy to scale (program works at 50 workers or 500)
```

### For Franchisees:
```
✅ Immediate competitive advantage vs other agencies
✅ Worker loyalty (best workers stay with them)
✅ Lower turnover costs
✅ Simple to implement (ORBIT tracks everything)
✅ Flexible (they decide tier amounts)
✅ Professional (shows they care about workers)
```

## 8. Edge Cases & Rules

### What Disqualifies You?

**Tier Drops or Disqualification:**
- Termination: Bonus forfeited
- Voluntary resignation: Bonus forfeited
- Sudden drop below 80%: Dropped to Tier 1
- Multiple violations: Tier reduced

**Example:**
```
Worker was Tier 3 (98%)
Then: 3 no-shows in one month
Drops to: 85%
New Tier: Tier 1
Bonus: Drops from $2,400 to $480
```

### What if Profitability Changes?

**Adjusting Bonus in Difficult Years:**

Option 1: Maintain bonuses (show loyalty to workers)
```
If profitable: Full bonus
If breaking even: 50% bonus
If losing money: 0 bonus
Workers understand and appreciate transparency
```

Option 2: Scale bonuses to profitability
```
If profit margin > 20%: Full tier bonus
If profit margin 10-20%: 70% of bonus
If profit margin 5-10%: 50% of bonus
If profit margin < 5%: No bonus
Transparent communication about "shared success"
```

### Promotion/Advancement?

**Long-term Loyal Workers Benefit:**
```
After 2+ years at Tier 3-4:
- Option to become "Lead Worker" (small raise)
- Supervise other workers on job sites
- Higher pay, more responsibility
- Start admin track to become Regional Rep

Example path:
Year 1: Worker, Tier 2, $1,500 bonus
Year 2: Worker, Tier 3, $2,400 bonus
Year 3: Lead Worker, $22/hr + bonuses
Year 4: Regional Rep, $3,500/month + small team
```

## 9. Communication Strategy

### For Workers:

**"This is not a normal staffing agency"**

When recruiting workers:
```
"Most agencies pay you for hours. We do too. 

But we also reward reliability.

Show up consistently? You get loyalty bonuses.

Miss shifts? That's okay, happens to everyone. 
But we notice and reward the ones who are always there.

Top performers earn an extra $2,400-5,000 per year.

That's real money. That's how we say thank you."
```

### For Employers (Your Franchisees):

**"Attract better workers"**

When pitching the program:
```
"Workers want to feel valued.

Most agencies offer nothing but hourly pay.

You offer loyalty bonuses.

Your best workers stay. They build relationships with your clients. 
They become reliable team members, not random temp workers.

This is a competitive advantage that costs you zero when times are tough, 
and pays dividends when times are good."
```

## 10. The Lean Company Model

### You (Jason): 3-4 Admins

```
Admin 1 (You): CEO / Licensing / Strategy
Admin 2: Customer Success / Franchisee Support
Admin 3: Operations / Tech Support
Admin 4 (optional): Accounting / HR

That's it. That's the whole company.

Everything else is: Franchisees run their own operations.
```

### Franchisee (Mike): Regional Team

```
Mike: Owner / CEO of his franchise
Manager 1: Customer Service / Employer relations
Manager 2: Worker Support / On-site presence
(maybe) Manager 3: Regional growth

That's the regional team. Maybe 3-4 people.

Everything else handled by ORBIT platform.
```

### Total Overhead:
```
ORBIT (you): 4 people running global platform
Franchise (Mike): 3 people running regional operation
Total: 7 people

Managing: 1,000+ workers
Generating: $5M-10M+ annual revenue
Profit: After franchisee split and costs: $1M-2M+
```

**That's the beauty of this model.**

## 12. Sample Year 1 Scenario

### ORBIT (Your Company):
```
You: 3 admins (you + 2 hires)
Revenue: Licensing fees from 5 franchisees × $19k/yr = $95k
Expenses: Salaries ($150k), hosting ($5k), ops ($10k) = $165k
Result: -$70k loss (expected Year 1, funded by you)
```

### Franchisee (Mike's Operation):
```
Mike: 1 owner + 2 staff = 3 people
Workers: 80 workers
Annual payroll: 80 workers × $1,500 hours × $20/hr = $2.4M
Revenue: $2.4M × 1.4 markup = $3.36M
Franchisee fees to you: $3.36M × 2% = $67k/year
Franchisee expenses:
  - Payroll: $2.4M
  - Payroll taxes: $300k
  - Workers comp: $60k
  - Insurance: $15k
  - Loyalty bonuses: ~$80k (avg $1k per worker)
  - Admin costs: $80k
  - Marketing: $40k
  Total: $2.975M

Mike's profit: $3.36M - $2.975M = $385k/year

Growth to 200 workers in Year 2:
  - Payroll: $6M
  - Revenue: $8.4M
  - Profit: ~$900k+

Year 3 with 300 workers:
  - Payroll: $9M
  - Revenue: $12.6M
  - Profit: ~$1.4M+
```

**That's a $1.4M/year business running 4 people (Mike + 3).**

That's the model. That's the dream.

**This program is YOUR competitive moat.**

Competitors offer hours. You offer loyalty rewards.

Competitors lose good workers. You keep them.

Competitors have high turnover. You have stability.

Competitors are desperate to fill shifts. You have workers waiting for opportunities.

**This is the difference between a "staffing app" and a "staffing OS."**

Build it. Perfect it. Make it legendary.
