# ORBIT Revenue Model: Subscription + Franchise

**Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete pricing strategy for two customer tiers  
**Goal:** Maximize addressable market while serving different customer needs

---

## 1. Overview: Two Paths to ORBIT

ORBIT serves two distinct markets with different financial capacity:

### Path A: SUBSCRIPTION (Small/Bootstrapping Agencies)
- Monthly payment model
- For agencies with $100k-500k revenue
- No upfront capital required
- Perfect for founders with hustle, not capital
- Monthly cost based on worker count

### Path B: FRANCHISE (Established Agencies)
- One-time licensing fee
- For agencies with $500k+ revenue or multi-region
- Permanent license (pay once, own forever)
- Lower lifetime cost than subscription
- Regional exclusivity option

## 4. Financial Comparison

### For a Small New Agency:

**Using Subscription Model:**
```
Worker count starts at: 5 workers
Monthly cost: $500/month = $6,000/year
Year 1 revenue estimate: $200,000 (5 workers × $20/hr × 40hrs × 52weeks × 1.4 markup)
Year 1 profit estimate: $50,000
Subscription as % of profit: 12%
Status: Sustainable, manageable
```

**Scaling up with Subscription:**
```
After 1 year: Grow to 15 workers
Monthly cost: $800/month = $9,600/year
Year 2 revenue estimate: $600,000
Year 2 profit estimate: $150,000
Subscription as % of profit: 6.4%
Status: Great margin, can grow

After 2 years: Grow to 50 workers
Monthly cost: $1,200/month = $14,400/year
Year 3 revenue estimate: $2,000,000
Year 3 profit estimate: $500,000
Subscription as % of profit: 2.9%
Status: Tiny % of profit, time to franchise
```

**Converting to Franchise:**
```
After 3 years on subscription:
- Paid total: $6k + $9.6k + $14.4k = $30,000 in subscriptions
- Now buying franchise: $19,000 one-time
- From this point: $0/month forever

Breakeven analysis:
- Franchise pays for itself vs subscription in 19 months ($19k ÷ $1,200/month)
- After 19 months, every dollar stays with franchisee
- 10-year value: Franchise saves $144,000+ vs continuing subscription
```

---

### For Established Agency Considering Both:

**Scenario A: Stay on Subscription Indefinitely**
```
50 workers: $1,200/month = $14,400/year ongoing
100 workers: $1,600/month = $19,200/year ongoing
200 workers: $2,000/month = $24,000/year ongoing

Over 10 years:
- 50 workers: $144,000 paid
- 100 workers: $192,000 paid
- 200 workers: $240,000 paid
```

**Scenario B: Buy Franchise License Instead**
```
One-time: $19,000
Ongoing: $0/month forever

Over 10 years:
- Cost: $19,000
- Savings vs 200-worker subscription: $221,000
```

**The Economics Are Clear:**
- Small/new agencies = Subscription makes sense (no upfront capital)
- Growing agencies = Franchise makes sense after 18-24 months
- Established agencies = Franchise is obvious choice

---

## 5. Customer Segmentation

### Who Chooses Subscription?

```
Profile: Bootstrapped founder or small established agency
Capital: Under $25,000
Worker count: 5-50 currently
Revenue: $100k-500k/year
Situation: "I need software NOW, but can't afford $19k upfront"
Timeline: Plan to franchise in 18-24 months
```

**Examples:**
- Solo founder starting first agency (literally none at launch)
- Retired manager starting side staffing gig
- Marketing professional pivoting to staffing
- Small agency with 15 workers, stuck on legacy system

### Who Chooses Franchise?

```
Profile: Established agency owner or serious operator
Capital: $19,000+ available
Worker count: 50-500+ currently
Revenue: $500k-2M+/year
Situation: "I'm serious about this. I want perpetual ownership."
Timeline: Ready to scale immediately
```

**Examples:**
- Regional staffing agency that's been around 5+ years
- Owner with 3+ successful agencies already
- PE-backed operator scaling across territories
- Staffing manager branching out to own agency

## 6. Conversion Strategy: Subscription → Franchise

### The Funnel:

```
Month 0: Sign up for subscription ($500/month, 5 workers)
└─ User: Learning the system, building client base

Month 6: Growing to 10-15 workers
└─ Subscription: $500-800/month
└─ User thinking: "This is working, can I own it?"
└─ ORBIT: Send "Franchise Opportunity" info (soft touch)

Month 12: 20-30 workers
└─ Subscription: $800-1,200/month
└─ User thinking: "At this rate, I should buy the license"
└─ ORBIT: "You've paid $7,200 in subscription. For $19k, own it forever"

Month 18: 40-50 workers
└─ Subscription: $1,200/month
└─ User math: "Franchise pays for itself in 19 months. Do it."
└─ ORBIT: Franchise onboarding
└─ Conversion: $19,000 license purchase

Ongoing: Franchisee
└─ Pays $0/month
└─ Owns forever
└─ Grows to 100-200 workers
└─ Your lifetime value: $30k (subscription) + $19k (franchise) = $49k+
└─ Their lifetime value: Everything they make
```

### Nurture Sequence:

**Month 6 Email:**
```
Subject: "Your ORBIT Growth is Impressive - Here's an Opportunity"

Hi [Name],

You've grown from 5 to 15 workers in 6 months. That's incredible.

You're currently on our subscription at $800/month.

Have you considered owning ORBIT outright?

For $19,000, you get:
- No monthly fees forever
- Complete ownership
- Full customization rights
- Regional exclusivity (optional)

Even if you never use that option, many of our fastest-growing partners have found 
that ownership aligns incentives better. You own the relationship with your workers.

```

**Month 12 Email:**
```
Subject: "You've Earned Your ORBIT License"

Hi [Name],

You've paid $7,200 in subscription fees and grown to 40 workers.

Here's the math:
- Your current subscription: $1,200/month = $14,400/year
- ORBIT perpetual license: $19,000 one-time
- Breakeven: 19 months
- After that: $0/month forever

At your growth rate, you'll be at 100 workers in 24 months.

Would $14,400/year at 100 workers feel expensive? (It would be $144/worker/year)

Or would owning a $19k license that scales to any size feel better?

Let's talk.
```

**Month 18+ Offer:**
```
"You're Ready for Franchising"

Over 18 months, you've proven this model works.

Move from subscription to franchising:
✅ Lower costs long-term
✅ Own the technology
✅ Access to franchisee network
✅ Regional exclusivity available
✅ Full year 1 support included

Conversion is simple:
1. We credit your subscription fees toward the license ($16,200 credit on $19,000)
2. You pay: $2,800 (instead of $19,000)
3. You own it forever

Essentially: You pay $2,800 more and own it perpetually.

Ready?

## 8. The Competitive Advantage

### Subscription + Franchise Model vs Competitors:

| Aspect | Competitor | ORBIT |
|---|---|---|
| New founder path | High cost upfront ($5k/month SaaS) | Low cost entry ($500/month) |
| Established agency path | Expensive long-term | Own it outright ($19k) |
| Customer acquisition | Pay per use forever | Pay once, then own |
| Customer retention | Locked in via cost | Locked in via network |
| Network effect | None (each customer isolated) | Strong (franchisees share platform) |
| Support | Per-tier pricing | Included in license |

**Result:** You capture both underserved markets (bootstrapped founders AND established agencies).

---

## 9. Operational Complexity

### Support Requirement Comparison:

**Subscription customers:**
- ✅ Email support (light)
- ✅ Self-serve knowledge base
- ✅ Monthly check-ins (can be automated)
- ✅ Churn risk if underdelivering
- ✅ Lower profitability per customer (small size)

**Franchise customers:**
- ✅ Higher touch in Year 1 (onboarding)
- ✅ Lower touch Year 2+ (they own it)
- ✅ Regional reps make visits
- ✅ Low churn (own perpetually)
- ✅ Higher profitability per customer

**Your task:**
- Focus support on subscription (retention → conversion)
- Invest in franchise onboarding (lock them in for life)
- Build community (franchisees support each other)

## 10. Implementation Plan

### Launch Phase (Months 1-3):

```
[ ] Publish subscription pricing page
[ ] Set up subscription billing (Stripe)

```

### Scale Phase (Year 2+):

```
[ ] Reach 40 subscription customers

```

## 11. Bottom Line

**You have TWO revenue streams:**

1. **Subscription Revenue:** Continuous, recurring, but smaller per customer
2. **Franchise Revenue:** One-time large, but leads to network effect and scale

**Subscription serves as:**
- Customer acquisition funnel
- Franchise conversion pipeline
- Validation of the model at smaller scale
- Recurring revenue stream

**Franchise serves as:**
- Long-term partnership model
- Network effects driver
- Scalability without headcount
- Lifetime value creator

**Combined:** You capture the entire market from $100k agencies (subscription) to $2M+ agencies (franchise), and everyone in between.

That's not competing. That's owning the entire market tier.
