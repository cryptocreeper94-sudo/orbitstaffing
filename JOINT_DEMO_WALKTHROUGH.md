## 💬 Key Talking Points

**You explain to Sidonie:**
> "See how this eliminates buddy clocking? GPS verification is built-in. We get paid correctly. Workers get paid instantly. Everything is automated—I didn't enter a single time entry."

**Sidonie observes:**
> "The admin dashboard shows every detail in real-time. GPS coordinates, timestamps, payment status, compliance records—all automatically documented. If labor comes knocking, we're audit-ready."

**Employee (if present):**
> "I clocked in with GPS, worked, clocked out, and I'm already seeing my $195 payment. This is so much better than waiting 2 weeks for a check."

## 🎓 Key Insights to Share

**On GPS Verification:**
"That's $50-200k per year in fraud prevention. Workers can't buddy clock. Clients can't dispute hours."

**On Automation:**
"That entire cycle took 12 minutes. Manually? That's 2-3 hours of admin work per day."

**On Worker Retention:**
"Workers who get paid same-day with bonuses? They come back. 3x longer retention."

**On Compliance:**
"Every action timestamped, GPS verified, recorded, and audit-ready. Labor board comes calling? We pass inspection."
