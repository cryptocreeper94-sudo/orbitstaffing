## 2. REQUIRED Insurance

### 2.1 Workers' Compensation Insurance (REQUIRED)

**What it is:**
- Covers medical costs and lost wages if a worker is injured on the job
- Required by law in almost all states
- Employer must carry it; workers cannot opt out

**Why it's required:**
- Worker gets injured? Your company pays the medical bills + lost wages
- Without workers' comp: You pay out of pocket (can be $100k+)
- Workers comp caps your liability
- Legal requirement in 49 of 50 states

**Who pays:**
- You pay the insurance premium
- NOT deducted from worker wages
- Premium based on: industry, number of employees, claims history

**What it covers:**
- Medical treatment (doctor, hospital, surgery, rehab)
- Partial wage replacement (typically 66% of average wage)
- Permanent disability
- Death benefits to family

**What it DOES NOT cover:**
- Willful negligence or recklessness
- Injuries from illegal activity
- Self-inflicted injuries
- Violations of safety rules

**Cost:**
- $1,000-5,000/year depending on industry and number of workers
- For staffing: Typically $3,000-10,000/year (higher due to worker injury risk)
- Premium = Number of Employees × Rate × Industry Modifier

**How to get it:**
- Contact your state's Department of Labor for approved carriers
- Get quotes from 2-3 insurers
- Compare coverage and rates
- Typical carriers: AIG, Liberty Mutual, Hartford, State Fund

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST inform workers they're covered. Include in handbook or onboarding.

**What it is:**

## 6. Benefits You Can Offer to Workers

**These are OPTIONAL** - you're not required by law to offer any of these, but they help attract/retain good workers:
