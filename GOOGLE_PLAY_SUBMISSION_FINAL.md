## STEP 4: Add Screenshots

You need 2-8 screenshots. Options:

**Option A: Use Demo Screenshots (Fast)**
Take screenshots from running app on your phone/emulator showing:
1. Login screen
2. Clock-in with GPS verification
3. Current assignment
4. Bonuses tab (weekly bonus)
5. Loyalty score dashboard
6. Earnings/pay
7. Messages
8. Jobs list

**Option B: Use Placeholder Graphics (Fastest)**
Create simple graphics showing:
- App name: "ORBIT Staffing"
- Key feature: "GPS Verified Check-In"
- Bonuses highlight: "$35/week + Annual Rewards"

Google Play accepts any screenshots. They just need to show what app does.

---

## STEP 5: Add App Icon

Need: 512x512 PNG

Use: Your ORBIT logo (should be in project assets)

---

## STEP 6: Build the APK

This is the technical part, but you've done similar before with Vercel.

**Option A: Use EAS Build (Easiest, Recommended)**

```bash
# From Replit terminal:
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo (free account)
eas login

# Build APK (creates signed APK)
eas build --platform android --non-interactive

# Download when ready
# Link provided in terminal
```

**Option B: Build Locally (If EAS doesn't work)**

```bash
# Uses local Android SDK
expo build:android
```

**Result:** You get `app-release.apk` file

---

## STEP 7: Upload APK to Console

1. In Console: Go to "Releases" → "Production"
2. Click "Create New Release"
3. Upload the APK file
4. Add release notes:

```
Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release

✓ GPS-verified check-in/check-out
