## 13. WORKER CONVERSION & BUYOUT POLICY

### 13.1 Worker Arrangement Types
ORBIT supports flexible engagement models to accommodate diverse staffing needs:

| Arrangement Type | Definition | Duration | Typical Use |
|------------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Day Labor** | Single-day assignments, no commitment | 1 day | Event staffing, emergency fill-ins |
| **Weekly** | Recurring assignments, week-to-week | 7 days (repeating) | Regular but flexible positions |
| **Part-Time** | 3-5 days/week ongoing | Ongoing | Semi-regular workforce |
| **Semi-Permanent** | 6+ months intended tenure, no conversion plan | 6+ months | Long-term temp workforce |
| **Permanent** | Intended path to full-time employment | Until conversion | Pipeline for permanent hiring |

**Worker Status Definition:**
- Each assignment is tagged with an arrangement type
- Worker can have multiple arrangement types with different clients simultaneously
- Arrangement type determines conversion eligibility and buyout policies

### 13.2 Permanent Conversion Policy (Full-Time Hiring)

**Industry Standard - Modified for ORBIT:**

When a Client intends to hire a Worker as a **full-time permanent employee**, the following buyout policy applies:

#### **Payment Requirement BEFORE Direct Hire:**
- **Less than 480 hours:** No ORBIT buyout fee (Client can hire directly)
- **480-960 hours (6-12 months):** $2,000 buyout fee required to ORBIT
- **960+ hours (12+ months):** $4,000 buyout fee required to ORBIT

**Hours Calculation:**
- Count all hours worked through ORBIT for ANY Client, regardless of assignment type
- Minimum wage = 1 hour
- Exclude unpaid break time

**Example 1 - Mike's Agency:**
- Worker: "Jake"
- Total ORBIT hours: 420 hours (4 months)
- Direct hire request from Client A: **NO FEE** (under 480 hours)
- ORBIT: Acknowledges, removes worker from system, no payment required

**Example 2 - Mike's Agency:**
- Worker: "Sarah"
- Total ORBIT hours: 650 hours (8 months)
- Direct hire request from Client B: **$2,000 BUYOUT** required
- Process: Client B sends buyout fee to ORBIT, Sarah transitions to full-time employee
- ORBIT: Receives payment, releases worker, updates records

**Example 3 - Mike's Agency:**
- Worker: "Marcus"
- Total ORBIT hours: 1,200 hours (15 months, semi-permanent)
- Client C wants to hire Marcus full-time: **$4,000 BUYOUT** required
- Justification: Marcus has deep knowledge of Client C's operations; long-term relationship

#### **Why This Structure:**
✓ **Protects ORBIT:** Compensation for losing recurring revenue stream  
✓ **Protects Client:** Clear, predictable costs for converting temps to full-time  
✓ **Protects Worker:** Ensures they transition to stable employment with proper vetting  
✓ **Incentivizes Permanent Assignments:** Clients can commit longer = better for all parties  

### 13.3 Conversion Restrictions & Conditions

**Clients CANNOT bypass this policy by:**
- Hiring worker for "personal services" outside ORBIT system
- Creating fake "break" periods to reset hour counters
- Using contractor classification to avoid conversion fees
- Direct solicitation of workers without approval

**Penalties for Violation:**
- First violation: Warning + $5,000 penalty
- Second violation: Automatic account suspension
- Third violation: Permanent account termination + legal action

**ORBIT Enforcement:**
- GPS verification data proves hours actually worked
- Audit trails show all hour calculations
- Regular compliance checks for large clients
- Workers can report unreported violations

### 13.4 Worker Conversion Workflow

**Step 1: Client Intent**
- Client notifies ORBIT: "We want to hire [Worker] full-time"
- ORBIT pulls total hours, conversion status, fee (if applicable)

**Step 2: Worker Approval**
- Worker must explicitly consent to conversion
- Worker can decline (remains on ORBIT or leaves)
- ORBIT confirms worker wants full-time role

**Step 3: Management Approval**
- For "Permanent" arrangement type: ORBIT approves (automated)
- For other types: Client's ORBIT administrator confirms worker eligible
- ORBIT checks for contractual restrictions

**Step 4: Fee Payment (if required)**
- Client pays buyout fee directly to ORBIT (invoice issued)
- Payment must clear before conversion is final
- ORBIT sends confirmation, worker released

**Step 5: Final Release**
- Worker removed from ORBIT system
- Client receives offboarding documentation
- Worker's data archived (7-year retention)

### 13.5 Semi-Permanent & No-Conversion Arrangements

**Semi-Permanent Workers (No Conversion Path):**
- Worker explicitly classified as temporary indefinitely
- No buyout applies if direct hire attempted
- Client can hire directly anytime without ORBIT fee
- **Use Case:** Seasonal workers, event staff, specific short-term needs

**Restriction:** If Client uses "Semi-Permanent" to avoid conversion fees, ORBIT can:
- Reclassify to "Permanent" after 12 months
- Apply retroactive buyout fees ($4,000)
- Charge late fees (1% per month)

**Worker Protection:** Semi-Permanent workers told upfront—no path to full-time employment through ORBIT.

### 13.6 Competing Offers & Multiple Clients

**If Worker Gets Job Offers From Multiple Clients:**

Client A offers $18/hour full-time (480 hours worked)  
Client B offers $20/hour full-time (600 hours worked)

**Scenario:**
- Worker wants to work for Client B (higher pay)
- Client B pays $2,000 buyout (for 600 hours)
- Worker releases from Client A, starts Client B
- Fair process, no disputes

**ORBIT Role:**
- Don't referee; process whichever conversion comes first
- Once converted, worker cannot re-enter ORBIT for that Client
- Worker can work for different Client through ORBIT if needed

### 13.7 Client Liability for Bypass Attempts

If Client attempts to hire Worker outside ORBIT system without:
1. Obtaining ORBIT approval, OR
2. Paying required buyout fee

**Client is liable for:**
- $5,000 penalty (first offense) + buyout fee owed
- $10,000 penalty (second offense) + legal fees
- Account termination (third offense)
- Damages to ORBIT platform (lost recurring revenue)

**ORBIT's Right to Pursue:**
- Pursue claim in arbitration (per Section 12)
- Workers can testify re: unreported hours/work
- GPS data and timesheets are admissible evidence

### 13.8 Worker Protections During Conversion

**Workers Cannot Be Penalized For:**
- Requesting conversion to full-time employment
- Declining a direct hire offer
- Remaining on ORBIT longer than expected
- Reporting conversion violations

**Workers ARE Protected:**
- All hours worked count toward conversion (no hour "forgetting")
- Overtime, bonuses, commissions count as hours worked
- Conversion fees don't come out of worker pay
- Worker remains on ORBIT until final approval

---

## 15. SYSTEM DISCLAIMER & HUMAN ENVIRONMENT

### 15.1 Automated System with Human Management
**ORBIT is a hybrid system - automated where possible, human-managed where necessary.**

ORBIT Staffing OS operates as follows:
- **Automated:** Scheduling, payroll calculations, invoicing generation, compliance tracking, GPS verification
- **Human-Managed:** Invoice disputes, payment exceptions, worker complaints, compliance exceptions, fraud investigations
- **Manager Approval:** Staffing Agency managers approve all assignments, invoices, and conversions

### 15.2 Worker Integrity Dependency
**This system depends on worker honesty and integrity:**

Workers must:
- ✓ Clock in/out honestly via GPS at job location
- ✓ Report accurate hours worked
- ✓ Not claim hours not actually worked
- ✓ Not share GPS or login credentials
- ✓ Report suspicious activity immediately
- ✓ Maintain professional conduct with clients

ORBIT provides tools (GPS, audit trails, timesheets), but **cannot guarantee compliance if workers act dishonestly**. System is only as good as worker integrity.

### 15.3 Invoicing Dispute Resolution
**What happens if there's a dispute about hours/work documented:**

**Scenario 1: Worker claims 40 hours, GPS shows 25 hours**
- GPS verification is authoritative source
- Timesheet examined for discrepancies
- Manager reviews assignment notes
- **Resolution:** Payroll reflects GPS-verified hours
- Worker can appeal if they believe GPS error occurred

**Scenario 2: Client claims worker didn't show up, GPS shows worker present**
- GPS data takes precedence
- Client contact notes reviewed
- Manager investigates with both parties
- **Resolution:** Invoice generated based on GPS verification
- If client disputes, arbitration required

**Scenario 3: Technical glitch causes GPS error**
- Workers and clients can report GPS outages
- Manager reviews all available evidence (photos, client confirmation, worker statement)
- ORBIT makes good-faith resolution
- **ORBIT's commitment:** We will resolve disputes fairly and quickly (within 3 business days)

### 15.4 ORBIT's Commitment
**On our part:**

✓ We will investigate all disputes thoroughly  
✓ We will review GPS data, timesheets, and client notes  
✓ We will make good-faith decisions based on available evidence  
✓ We will not penalize workers or clients for honest disputes  
✓ We will resolve disputed invoices within 3 business days  

**However:**

❌ We cannot compensate for lost revenue due to worker no-shows  
❌ We cannot override GPS verification without overwhelming evidence  
❌ We cannot refund invoices already paid without clear fraud  
❌ We cannot guarantee 100% accuracy (this is human-dependent work)  

### 15.5 Staffing Industry Reality
**Understanding the nature of temporary workforce management:**

Staffing is inherently unpredictable:
- Workers sometimes call in sick or don't show
- Clients sometimes cancel assignments last-minute
- Hours sometimes vary day-to-day
- Availability is fluid and changeable
- Workers seek permanent positions and leave
- Clients' needs fluctuate

**ORBIT helps manage this chaos through:**
- Real-time scheduling and availability tracking
- GPS verification to prevent fraud
- Automated backup worker notifications
- Quick replacement assignment system
- Fair dispute resolution process

**ORBIT cannot eliminate this reality.** We provide the best tools and management, but staffing remains a dynamic, human-dependent business.

### 15.6 Worker Employment Verification
**ORBIT workers are temporary contractors, not employees.** This means:

- ✓ Workers are free to work for other staffing agencies
- ✓ Workers can decline assignments without penalty
- ✓ No guaranteed minimum hours
- ✓ No benefits (health insurance, 401k, PTO)
- ✓ Can be removed from platform for misconduct

**Workers should:**
- Always verify they're communicating with legitimate ORBIT staff
- Cross-reference manager names and contact info
- Check email addresses (official: @orbitstaffing.io)
- Never send payment upfront or provide personal financial info
- Report suspicious requests to support@orbitstaffing.io

### 15.7 System Managers & Escalation
**For disputes or issues:**

1. **First Level:** Assignment manager (handles scheduling, assignment issues)
2. **Second Level:** Compliance manager (handles payment, invoicing disputes)
3. **Third Level:** Operations director (handles major complaints, fraud)
4. **Final Level:** CEO/Owner (handles legal disputes, policy decisions)

**Manager limitations:**
- Managers cannot change system code or architecture
- Managers cannot override CEO decisions
- Managers cannot create new pricing tiers
- Managers cannot grant admin access (CEO only)
- Managers enforce policy but don't create it
