# ORBIT GPS Verification & Attendance Policy

**Effective Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Last Updated:** November 22, 2025  
**Status:** Legal - All Users Must Acknowledge

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes the terms, conditions, and procedures for GPS-based time and attendance verification in the ORBIT Staffing OS platform. The purpose is to:

- ✅ Ensure accurate timekeeping and payroll
- ✅ Prevent time fraud and unauthorized hours
- ✅ Protect employer clients from billing disputes
- ✅ Create objective, auditable records for all parties
- ✅ Maintain worker-employer trust through transparency

**This is NOT surveillance.** This is accountability and transparency for accurate payment.

## 2. How GPS Verification Works

### Clock-In Process
1. Worker opens ORBIT app at job location
2. App captures GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude)
3. App compares location to approved job address (default 300-foot radius)
4. If within radius: Clock-in allowed with timestamp
5. If outside radius: Warning shown, worker can try again or contact employer
6. All attempts logged (successful and failed)

### Clock-Out Process
Same process as clock-in. Both must be at approved location.

### Accuracy
- GPS accuracy: Typically ±15-30 feet (95% of the time)
- Timestamp: Precise to the second
- All data encrypted and stored securely

### No Tracking Between Clock-In and Clock-Out
- **ORBIT does NOT track worker location during work.**
- GPS is only captured at clock-in and clock-out moments.
- No real-time location tracking of worker movements.
- No surveillance of work activities.

---

## 3. Worker Responsibilities & Agreement

### By using ORBIT, workers agree to:

1. **Accurate Location at Clock-In/Out**
   - Clock in at the actual job location, not nearby
   - Clock out at the actual job location
   - Do not ask someone else to clock in/out for you
   - Do not use VPN, location spoofing, or fake GPS apps

2. **Device Management**
   - Keep phone charged and with you during shift
   - Keep GPS enabled during work hours
   - Report device loss/theft immediately to employer
   - Use authentic device ID (no rooting, jailbreaking, or emulation)

3. **Communication**
   - If GPS fails: Call employer immediately
   - If phone dies: Call or text employer with explanation
   - If location issue: Discuss with employer before situation escalates
   - Proactive communication prevents disputes

4. **Honest Attendance**
   - Show up when scheduled
   - Clock in when work begins
   - Clock out when work ends
   - Don't misrepresent your location or hours

### Violations & Consequences

**Minor Violations** (first instance):
- Failed clock-in outside radius: Requires employer approval to override
- GPS signal loss: Documented and reviewed
- **Consequence:** Warning, discussion with employer

**Repeated Violations** (2-3 instances):
- Pattern of GPS failures
- Consistent attempts to clock in from wrong location
- **Consequence:** Suspension from assignments, retraining required

**Serious Violations** (deliberate dishonesty):
- Using fake GPS/spoofing apps
- Having someone else clock in/out for you
- Clocking in but not actually being at job
- Deliberately providing false location data
- **Consequence:** Immediate termination, possible civil action

## 4. Employer Responsibilities & Agreement

### By using ORBIT, employers agree to:

1. **Clear Communication**
   - Inform workers about GPS policy before first shift
   - Provide copies of this policy
   - Explain what GPS is used for (accuracy, not surveillance)
   - Answer worker questions about GPS

2. **Fair Dispute Resolution**
   - If worker disputes GPS data: Investigate
   - Consider explanations (dead battery, GPS signal loss, etc.)
   - Review circumstances, not just data
   - Document all disputes and resolutions
   - Presume good faith until proven otherwise

3. **Reasonable Geofence Settings**
   - Set geofence radius at 300 feet (standard)
   - Adjust if job location has GPS signal issues
   - Communicate any custom radius to workers
   - Don't set unreasonably tight boundaries

4. **Privacy Protection**
   - Use GPS data ONLY for time/attendance
   - Do NOT track worker location between clock-in/out
   - Do NOT share location data with third parties
   - Delete GPS data per data retention policy
   - Comply with state privacy laws (CA, TX, IL, NY, etc.)

### Employer Liability

**ORBIT and employer are NOT liable for:**
- GPS signal loss or failure (Acts of God)
- Inaccurate GPS data from device (hardware issue)
- Worker device failures (phone died, no charge)
- Network connectivity issues (cell towers down)
- Worker deliberate misuse (fake GPS apps, spoofing)

**ORBIT and employer ARE liable for:**
- Misuse of GPS data (tracking beyond clock-in/out)
- Sharing GPS data without consent
- Violating worker privacy laws
- Discriminatory enforcement of GPS policy

## 5. Contingency: What If GPS Fails?

### Scenario 1: GPS Signal Loss (Tech Issue)
```
Worker at job location but GPS won't connect
→ Worker tries clock-in 2-3 times (documented)
→ Worker calls employer: "GPS not working, I'm here at 123 Main St"
→ Employer verifies worker presence (visual, photos, other workers)
→ Employer manually approves clock-in in system
→ Time recorded with note: "GPS failed, manually verified"
→ No penalty to worker
→ Issue logged for ORBIT technical team
```

### Scenario 2: Phone Dies/Lost During Shift
```
Worker's phone dies mid-shift
→ Worker borrows phone, calls employer
→ Employer verifies: "Yeah, [worker name] is here, been here all day"
→ Employer manually enters clock-out time
→ Note recorded: "Phone lost, employer verified hours"
→ Worker gets paid for full verified hours
→ No penalty to worker
→ Worker replaces phone, resumes normal GPS tracking
```

### Scenario 3: GPS Shows Worker NOT at Location
```
Worker claims to be at job
Worker's GPS shows 2 miles away
→ Employer checks: Did worker actually show up?
→ Call worker: "Your GPS shows you're not here. Where are you?"
→ Worker explanation options:
   a) "GPS is broken, but I'm definitely here" → Get photos, have others verify
   b) "I'm stuck in traffic, ETA 15 min" → Adjust clock-in time
   c) "I didn't show up, I'm sorry" → Absence recorded, discuss consequences
→ Based on explanation, employer decides: Manual override or absence?
```

### Scenario 4: Repeated GPS Discrepancies (Fraud Pattern)
```
Worker consistently:
- GPS shows 300+ feet from location
- Claims to be there
- No explanation
- Pattern over 3-4 shifts
→ Employer documents all incidents
→ Employer meets with worker: "This pattern concerns us"
→ Worker given chance to explain or stop
→ If continues: Reassign or terminate based on employer policy
→ Clear documentation protects both parties
```

## 7. Dispute Resolution Process

### If Worker Disputes GPS Data
```
Step 1: Worker contacts employer within 24 hours
Step 2: Employer reviews GPS data and circumstances
Step 3: Employer and worker discuss explanation
Step 4: Decision:
   - Accept worker explanation (manual override)
   - Deny claim (worker not actually there)
   - Escalate to ORBIT for technical review
Step 5: Document decision with reason
Step 6: If needed, escalate to ORBIT arbitration
```

### If Employer Disputes Worker Hours
```
Step 1: Employer flags GPS data as suspicious
Step 2: ORBIT technical team reviews GPS accuracy
Step 3: If data shows worker NOT at location: Employer can reject hours
Step 4: Worker notified with reason
Step 5: Worker can appeal with evidence (photos, witnesses)
Step 6: Final decision made by employer
Step 7: ORBIT arbitration available if dispute escalates
```

### Neither party has unilateral authority.
- Worker can't force payment for hours GPS shows they weren't there
- Employer can't reject legitimate hours without cause
- Both must document and explain all decisions
- ORBIT available to arbitrate unresolved disputes
