# Weekly Performance Bonus Economics

**Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Purpose:** Calculate the profitability threshold for weekly bonuses  
**Goal:** Make grass so green employees can't see competitors

---

## 1. The Strategy

**What triggers weekly bonus:**
1. Worker on-boards and checks: "I'm available for extended assignments"
2. Assignment is 6+ weeks (minimum duration)
3. Worker completes 2+ solid weeks (zero no-shows, zero tardies, on-time every day)
4. After week 2, you START weekly bonuses
5. Weekly bonus continues as long as worker maintains performance

**Why this works:**
- Incentivizes workers to show up consistently
- Rewards loyalty (only after proving themselves 2 weeks)
- Employer gets tested worker before paying bonus
- Bonus is small enough to be sustainable
- Bonus is big enough to feel meaningful

---

## 2. The Profitability Math

### Baseline: Typical Staffing Agency Margin

**Example Worker:**
```
Hourly rate to worker: $18/hour
Bill rate to client: $27/hour
Gross margin: $9/hour per worker

Worker works 40 hours/week
Gross margin per week: $9 × 40 = $360/week per worker

Agency operating costs (per worker):
- FICA taxes on payroll: $1.38/hour = $55/week
- Workers comp: $0.40/hour = $16/week
- Insurance/overhead: $0.50/hour = $20/week
- Admin/support: $0.30/hour = $12/week
Total operating costs: $2.58/hour = $103/week

Net margin per worker per week: $360 - $103 = $257/week

Or: $257/week ÷ 40 hours = $6.43/hour net profit per worker
```

**Annual breakdown (1 worker):**
```
Gross billing to client: $27/hr × 40 hrs/week × 52 weeks = $56,160
Payroll to worker: $18/hr × 40 hrs/week × 52 weeks = $37,440
Payroll taxes: $2,873
Workers comp: $832
Insurance/admin: $1,664
Total costs: $42,809
NET PROFIT: $13,351 per worker per year
```

**The question:** How much of that $13,351 annual profit can you share via weekly bonuses?

---

## 3. Weekly Bonus Options

### Option A: CONSERVATIVE (Keep 85% of profit)

**Weekly bonus: $20/week for workers on extended assignment**

```
Annual cost per worker: $20/week × 52 weeks = $1,040/year

Effect on profitability:
Before bonus: $13,351 profit
After bonus: $13,351 - $1,040 = $12,311 profit
Profit margin: 19.2% (still strong)

Per worker impact: $20/week ($5/week actually paid by you after client markup)
```

**Why this amount:**
- ✅ Meaningful to worker ($20 = 1 hour extra pay)
- ✅ Not reckless (only 7.8% of profit)
- ✅ Easy to sustain in good times and hard times
- ✅ Conservative, safe, still very profitable

---

### Option B: MODERATE (Keep 80% of profit)

**Weekly bonus: $35/week for workers on extended assignment**

```
Annual cost per worker: $35/week × 52 weeks = $1,820/year

Effect on profitability:
Before bonus: $13,351 profit
After bonus: $13,351 - $1,820 = $11,531 profit
Profit margin: 17.0% (solid)

Per worker impact: $35/week ($8-10/week actually paid by you after margin)
```

**Why this amount:**
- ✅ Very meaningful to worker ($35 = nearly 2 hours pay)
- ✅ Significant differentiation vs competitors
- ✅ Still maintain strong profitability
- ✅ Can sustain even in down quarters

---

### Option C: AGGRESSIVE (Keep 75% of profit)

**Weekly bonus: $50/week for workers on extended assignment**

```
Annual cost per worker: $50/week × 52 weeks = $2,600/year

Effect on profitability:
Before bonus: $13,351 profit
After bonus: $13,351 - $2,600 = $10,751 profit
Profit margin: 15.8% (healthy)

Per worker impact: $50/week ($12-15/week actually paid by you after margin)
```

**Why this amount:**
- ✅ VERY meaningful to worker ($50 = ~2.75 hours extra pay)
- ✅ MASSIVE competitive advantage
- ✅ Workers choose you over everyone
- ✅ Can sustain this if you stay lean (no bloated overhead)

---

### Option D: MAXIMUM (Keep 70% of profit)

**Weekly bonus: $75/week for workers on extended assignment**

```
Annual cost per worker: $75/week × 52 weeks = $3,900/year

Effect on profitability:
Before bonus: $13,351 profit
After bonus: $13,351 - $3,900 = $9,451 profit
Profit margin: 13.9% (still profitable but tighter)

Per worker impact: $75/week ($18-20/week actually paid by you after margin)
```

**Why this amount:**
- ✅ EXTRAORDINARY to worker ($75 = $1/hour raise effectively)
- ✅ UNBEATABLE competitive advantage
- ⚠️ Risky if revenue drops or workers get injured
- ⚠️ Requires very lean operations (3-4 admins, not more)

**Risk:** If you hit unexpected costs (workers comp claim, bad client), you're squeezed.

## 4. My Recommendation: The Goldilocks Zone

**Go with Option B: $35/week**

### Why:
1. **Meaningful to workers** - That's $1,820/year extra for showing up reliably
2. **Competitive advantage** - Most agencies offer $0, you offer $35/week
3. **Sustainable** - Works in good times AND bad times
4. **Safe** - Still 80% of your profit (plenty of cushion)
5. **Scalable** - Can add more workers without going broke

### The Math:
```
Your Agency: 50 Workers on extended assignments
Weekly bonus cost: $35 × 50 = $1,750/week
Annual cost: $1,750 × 52 = $91,000/year

Your annual profit: 50 workers × $11,531 each = $576,550/year

That's $576k annual profit from 50 workers (3-4 admins).
That's $144k per admin. That's sustainable and scalable.
```

### Scale to 200 workers:
```
200 workers × $35/week × 52 weeks = $364,000/year
200 workers × $11,531 profit each = $2,306,200/year
Profit: $2.3M from one franchisee with 4 people running it
```

## 5. How Weekly Bonus Actually Works

### Setup:
```
Worker on-boards:
☑ "I'm available for extended assignments (6+ weeks)"

Employer posts 6-week contract
Worker accepted

Week 1: No bonus yet (proving yourself)
- Must show: Perfect attendance, on-time, no issues
- Monitored closely by employer

Week 2: Final check
- Zero no-shows
- Zero tardies
- All breaks on-time
- Full hours worked
- Good feedback from employer
If yes → Eligible for weekly bonus starting Week 3
If no → Back to zero, next week try again

Week 3+: Weekly bonus starts
- Every Friday: $35 bonus automatically
- Continues as long as performance stays good
- One violation (tardy, no-show) = bonus paused
- Two violations in 4 weeks = bonus forfeited
- Return to good standing = bonus resumes
```

### In the App (Worker sees):
```
EXTENDED ASSIGNMENT BONUS

Assignment: BuildCo Project (Started Sept 1)
Duration: 12 weeks | Days completed: 10 | Days remaining: 54

Bonus Status: ACTIVE ✅
├─ Week 1-2: Evaluation period
├─ Week 3+: Earning $35/week
├─ This week: $35 ✅
├─ Total earned: $70

Streaks:
├─ Perfect attendance: 10 days
├─ On-time arrivals: 10 days
├─ No violations: 10 days

One more week of perfect: Tier up to $40/week? (Ask employer)
```

### In Admin Dashboard:
```
WEEKLY BONUS PERFORMANCE

Active Extended Assignments: 18
├─ Bonus cost this week: $630 (18 workers × $35)
├─ Bonus cost this month: $2,520
├─ Bonus cost this year (projected): $32,760

Top performers:
├─ Sarah (12 weeks): $420 earned, perfect record
├─ Mike (8 weeks): $280 earned, 1 tardy (paused 1 week)
├─ Jennifer (6 weeks): $140 earned, on track

Profit impact:
├─ Gross margin: $18,900/week
├─ Bonus cost: $630/week
├─ After bonus: $18,270/week
├─ Margin: 96.7% (still huge)
```

## 6. Tier-Up Option (Gamification)

**If worker is perfect for 6+ weeks, they can tier up:**

```
Week 1-2: Evaluation ($0)
Week 3-6: Tier 1 ($35/week)
Week 7+: Tier 2 ($40/week) if perfect record

Or:

Week 1-2: Evaluation
Week 3-8: Tier 1 ($35/week)
Week 9-12: Tier 2 ($40/week) if perfect
Week 13+: Tier 3 ($50/week) if still perfect
```

**Why this works:**
- Gamifies the system (workers chase higher tiers)
- Rewards long-term loyalty
- Employer sees worker progression
- Worker feels valued and invested

**Example (Perfect worker, 12-week assignment):**
```
Week 1-2: $0 (evaluation)
Week 3-8: $35 × 6 = $210
Week 9-12: $40 × 4 = $160
Total: $370 for 12-week assignment

Plus annual loyalty bonus (Tier 3-4): $2,400+
Total annual: $2,770 extra for being reliable
```

That's not just a bonus. That's a lifestyle change for a temp worker.

## 7. The Competitive Moat

**What your competitors do:**
```
Agency A (Bullhorn):
- Pays $18/hour
- No bonuses
- Worker: "Let me check what Agency B pays..."

Agency B (CEIPAL):
- Pays $18/hour
- No bonuses
- Same situation

Agency C (Zelos):
- Pays $18/hour
- No bonuses
- Still losing workers
```

**What you do (ORBIT):**
```
Agency ORBIT:
- Pays $18/hour
- $35/week bonus for reliable work ($1,820/year)
- Plus $2,400+ annual loyalty bonus (Tier 3)
- Total extra: $4,220/year for a temp worker

Worker does the math:
$18/hr at Agency A = $37,440/year base
$18/hr at ORBIT = $37,440 + $4,220 = $41,660/year

That's a 11% effective raise just for showing up.

Worker: "I'm working at ORBIT."
```

**The result:**
- ✅ Best workers flock to you
- ✅ Competitors' quality drops (you took their stars)
- ✅ Employers prefer you (more reliable workers)
- ✅ Franchisees scale faster (good workers = happy clients = more contracts)

## 10. The Bottom Line

**You asked: "What's fair, what's low, what's high?"**

**My answer:**

- **Too low ($0-10/week):** Nobody notices, no competitive advantage
- **Low ($20/week):** Good, safe, minimal difference vs competitors
- **Sweet spot ($35/week):** Meaningful, sustainable, major competitive advantage ✅ RECOMMENDED
- **High ($50/week):** Extraordinary, unbeatable, requires lean operations
- **Too high ($75+/week):** Risky, unsustainable, margins get squeezed

**What keeps you profitable:**
```
Stay under $2,600/worker/year in weekly bonuses
That leaves you $10,751+ profit per worker
With 3-4 admins, you can easily scale to 200+ workers
That's $2M+ profit, scalable, sustainable, defensible
```

**The strategy:**
Start with $35/week. That's enough to be legendary and sustainable. As you grow and hit $2M+ profit/year, you can go to $50/week and still be healthy.

## 11. Why This Makes Grass So Green

**Math for a $18/hour worker:**

```
Agency A (competitor):
Base: $18/hr × 2,080 hours = $37,440/year
Bonuses: $0
Total: $37,440/year
Benefits: None
Safety: Worried about getting hurt (no workers comp clear communication)

You (ORBIT at Moderate tier):
Base: $18/hr × 2,080 hours = $37,440/year
Weekly bonus: $35 × 52 weeks = $1,820/year (if on extended assignment)
Annual loyalty bonus: $2,400/year (Tier 3)
Total: $37,440 + $1,820 + $2,400 = $41,660/year
Benefits: Clear, transparent, documented
Safety: Workers comp, insurance, professional company

Difference: $4,220/year more (11% effective raise)

Worker's decision: "Why would I work anywhere else?"
```

You've just made temp work feel like a real career with upside.

That's the moat. That's why you win. That's why employees come to you first.

**Next step:** Implement $35/week, launch, watch competitors lose their best people to you. 🚀
