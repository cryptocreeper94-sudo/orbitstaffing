## The Pitch

**"Mike, look - you're currently running Superior Staffing across how many different systems? 6? 7? You're spending maybe $2,600 a year on software, plus 20 hours a month manually entering data across all those platforms.**

**I built ORBIT specifically to solve this problem. It's everything you need: CRM, payroll, invoicing, scheduling, worker management - all in ONE app. Everything from your phone. No more juggling systems.**

**It's white-labeled as Superior Staffing - your branding, your domain, your platform. You own it.**

**Here's the deal: $19,000, one-time. That's it. No monthly fees. No recurring charges. You buy it once, you own it forever.**

**By year 2, you've saved more than the investment just on software costs. Plus you get back 20 hours a month in your life. Plus you have the infrastructure to scale back up when you rebuild your sales team.**

**And here's what makes it special: For the first 12 months, you can request any features you need. Sales tracker? Done. Custom reports? Done. Integration with your accounting software? We'll do it. You tell us what would help Superior Staffing run better, and we customize it for you. This is YOUR system, built for YOUR business.**

**After year one, if you need ongoing support or customization, it's $2,000/year. But the platform itself? It's yours forever. What do you think?"**

## How the Customization Process Works

### 1. Mike Submits Feature Request
- Goes to `/feature-requests` in his admin panel
- Clicks "Suggest a Feature"
- Fills in:
  - Feature Title: "QuickBooks Auto-Sync"
  - Description: "Automatically sync payroll to QuickBooks daily"
  - Category: "Integration"
  - Priority: "High"
- Clicks Submit

### 2. You Get Notified
- Request appears in admin dashboard
- Shows all requests with status: Open → In Review → Planned → In Progress → Completed
- You review and prioritize

### 3. Development & Implementation
- You estimate the implementation
- You update the request status: "Planned" → "In Progress"
- You set estimated completion date
- You build the feature

### 4. Delivery & Update
- Feature is deployed
- Request status: "Completed"
- Mike sees it automatically in his system
- New feature is live - no separate deployment needed

### 5. Ongoing
- Mike gets automatic updates
- Any features added to ORBIT, he gets them
- This continues for the 12-month warranty period
