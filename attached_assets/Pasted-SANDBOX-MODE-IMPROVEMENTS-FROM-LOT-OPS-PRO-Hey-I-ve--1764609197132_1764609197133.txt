SANDBOX MODE IMPROVEMENTS FROM LOT OPS PRO
==========================================

Hey! I've been working on Lot Ops Pro which has an advanced sandbox system. Here are features you should consider adding to ORBIT's sandbox:

1. ROLE-BASED WELCOME FLOW
   - When user enters sandbox, show a welcome dialog with their name/role
   - Offer "Start Guided Tour" or "Explore on my own" options
   - Track if user has seen welcome to avoid repeating

2. SHIFT CODE GATING FOR "GO LIVE"
   - Sandbox users see "Go Live? Get shift code" CTA
   - Supervisors generate daily shift codes
   - Users must enter valid code to exit sandbox → live mode
   - Prevents accidental production data writes

3. SIMULATED AUTO-RESPONSES
   - In sandbox, messages get simulated responses after delay
   - Makes the app feel alive during training
   - Example responses: "✅ Message received!", "👍 On it!", "📍 ETA 5 minutes"

4. MULTIPLE VISUAL VARIANTS
   - SandboxBanner (full-width top bar)
   - SandboxStatusCard (fancy card with glow effects)
   - SandboxStatusCompact (small inline badge)
   - Use different ones based on page context

5. INTEGRATED TOUR SYSTEM
   - Sandbox welcome triggers interactive tour
   - Role-specific tour steps (different for drivers vs supervisors)
   - Highlights key UI elements with tooltips

6. WORKFLOW TIPS BY PAGE
   - Show contextual tips based on current page + user role
   - Example: On scanner page → "💡 Scan multiple items to see batch processing"
   - Helps users learn while exploring

7. useSandboxDataWithFallback HOOK
   - Enhanced version of useSandboxData
   - Shows demo data during loading states too
   - Signature: useSandboxDataWithFallback(realData, demoData, isLoading)

VISUAL THEME SUGGESTION:
- Keep cyan for ORBIT (different from Lot Ops Pro's purple)
- Add subtle glow/pulse animations to sandbox indicators
- Use gradient backgrounds for premium feel

ARCHITECTURE:
src/contexts/SandboxModeContext.tsx  → Provider + useSandboxMode hook
src/components/SandboxWelcome.tsx    → First-time welcome dialog
src/components/SandboxStatusBanner.tsx → Multiple visual variants
src/hooks/useSandboxData.ts          → Data switching hooks
src/data/sandbox/fixtures.ts         → Centralized demo data
src/data/sandbox/simulation.ts       → Auto-responses, simulated movement

The key insight: Sandbox isn't just about showing demo data - it's about TRAINING users safely before they touch real data. The welcome flow + tour + shift code gating creates a complete onboarding experience.
