## The Problem We're Solving

### Staffing Industry Pain Points:
1. **Manual Work:** Agencies spend 40-60% of time on admin (not revenue-generating)
2. **High Costs:** ADP/Bullhorn charge $99-$799/month (agencies can't afford)
3. **Poor Technology:** Legacy systems (1990s platforms) don't support mobile-first workers
4. **Data Isolation:** No marketplace connecting workers to jobs efficiently
5. **No Banking Integration:** Can't compete with ADP on enterprise features

### Market Size:
- **Total US Staffing Market:** $217B annually
- **Mid-Market Segment (100-1,000 workers):** $35B
- **Digital-First Agencies (our TAM):** $5-8B

## Investment Structure

### Equity Structure (Pre-Investment):

**Total Company:** 10M shares

| Stakeholder | Shares | % Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| Founder/Team | 8.5M | 85% |
| **Available for Series Seed** | **1.5M** | **15%** |

**Post-Investment (assuming $750K at $5M valuation):**

| Stakeholder | Shares | % Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| Founder/Team | 8.5M | 70% |
| **New Investors** | **1.5M** | **15%** |
| **ESOP (Employee Pool)** | **1.0M** | **10%** |
| **Option Pool** | **1.0M** | **5%** |

### Valuation:

**Pre-Money Valuation:** $4.25M (based on revenue + growth trajectory)  
**Investment:** $750K  
**Post-Money Valuation:** $5M  
**Investor Ownership:** 15%

**Valuation Math:**
- ARR: $1M (year 1 projection)
- Typical SaaS multiple: 5-8x
- Conservative: 5x = $5M valuation
- Investors get: $750K / $5M = 15%

---

## Terms & Conditions (Standard Seed Round)

### Investment Structure: **SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)**

A SAFE is a **convertible note** that converts to equity later. Standard terms:

- **Investment Type:** SAFE (not equity yet)
- **Amount:** $750K
- **Valuation Cap:** $5M (highest price investor pays per share)
- **Discount:** 20% (investor gets 20% discount on Series A)
- **Pro-rata Rights:** Investors can participate in future rounds
- **Conversion Trigger:** Series A fundraising or acquisition (not on time)

**Example:** If Series A happens at $10M valuation (2x growth):
- Investor's $750K converts at $5M cap with 20% discount
- Price per share: $10M valuation with 20% discount = $8M effective
- Investor gets: $750K / $8M = ~9.4% (better than 7.5% if no discount)

### Standard Terms Summary:

| Term | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Investment Type** | SAFE | Standard for seed rounds, simple |
| **Valuation Cap** | $5M | Based on ARR + growth |
| **Discount** | 20% | Rewards early investors |
| **Pro-Rata** | Yes | Investors can join future rounds |
| **Liquidation Pref** | 1x non-participating | No preferential payout on exit |
| **Anti-Dilution** | Weighted average | Fair to all parties |

## Exit Strategy (Return on Investment)

Investors typically exit via:

### Option 1: Acquisition (Most Likely)
**By:** ADP, Workday, Bullhorn, or staffing platform acquirer  
**Timeline:** 3-5 years  
**Valuation Multiple:** 5-10x ARR (typical SaaS exit)  
**Return:** If ORBIT hits $8M ARR @ 8x = $64M exit
- Investor gets: 15% × $64M = **$9.6M** on $750K investment (**12.8x return**)

### Option 2: Strategic Acquisition (Faster)
**By:** Large staffing company (Kelly Services, Kforce, Hudson Global)  
**Timeline:** 2-3 years  
**Valuation Multiple:** 3-5x ARR  
**Return:** If ORBIT hits $5M ARR @ 4x = $20M exit
- Investor gets: 15% × $20M = **$3M** on $750K investment (**4x return**)

### Option 3: IPO (Longer Timeline)
**Timeline:** 5-7 years  
**Valuation:** $200M+ market cap  
**Return:** Potential **20-50x**, but less likely for staffing vertical

### Option 4: Secondary Round
**Timeline:** If no acquisition by year 3-4, raise Series B/C  
**Use Case:** Expand to new verticals (healthcare, IT staffing)  
**Valuation Growth:** Each round typically 2-3x previous

## Key Investor Questions & Answers

**Q: Why are you raising now vs. bootstrapping?**  
A: We're profitable at MVP scale ($1M ARR). Raising accelerates customer acquisition (sales team, marketing) and enterprise features (ISO 20022) that open Fortune 500 market. But we don't *need* capital—this is a growth accelerator.

**Q: What's your unfair advantage?**  
A: 60-68% cheaper than competitors + 100% automation + white-label ready. Network effects from Talent Exchange marketplace lock in customers once we hit critical mass.

**Q: What if staffing agencies don't adopt your pricing?**  
A: They already are. 20+ pilot customers at current prices. Market is moving to SaaS (34% of staffing is digital today, growing). We just offer better value.

**Q: How do you compete with ADP (huge, well-funded)?**  
A: ADP targets enterprises ($500K+/year spend). We target mid-market ($39-249/mo). Different markets. We can't beat them on sales force—we beat them on product & speed.

**Q: What's your exit timeline?**  
A: Likely acquisition at 3-5 years by ADP, Workday, Bullhorn, or staffing platform. IPO possible but less likely for this vertical.

**Q: What's the downside?**  
A: Market adoption slower than expected, ADP enters our segment, economic downturn in staffing. Mitigation: conservative financial model, strong tech moat, diversified customer base.

**Q: Do you have any revenue yet?**  
A: Yes, $50K in pilot revenue. Target $1M ARR by end of 2026.

## FAQ for Investors

**Q: What's a SAFE?**  
A: Like a convertible note. You invest $750K today. It converts to equity when we fundraise Series A or get acquired. You don't own equity yet; you own the right to equity later.

**Q: Why SAFE vs. equity?**  
A: Simpler, faster, cheaper. SAFE takes 1 week to close vs. 4-6 weeks for traditional equity. Legal fees: $500 vs $3-5K.

**Q: Can I get a board seat?**  
A: Lead investor gets board observer seat (attends meetings, gets info). Board seat only if leading $500K+.

**Q: What if you get acquired at $20M (not $64M)?**  
A: Your $750K at $5M cap converts to ~$2.25M in the acquisition. That's 3x return. Still good!

**Q: What if you run out of money?**  
A: Unlikely. We break even at $200 customers (year 1), $500 by year 2. Runway: 18+ months if we stop growing today.

**Q: Can I invest $100K (not full $750K)?**  
A: Yes. Pro-rata same terms. Same valuation, same SAFE agreement.

**Q: When do I see returns?**  
A: Likely 3-5 years (acquisition), or series B/C in 2-3 years (secondary liquidity).

**Q: What happens if you don't hit projections?**  
A: Typical startup journey. We adjust timeline but stay profitable. Worst case: profitable solo company generating $500K-1M ARR. Not an exit, but not a loss either.
