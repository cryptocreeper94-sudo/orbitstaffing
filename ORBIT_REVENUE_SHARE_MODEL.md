# ORBIT Revenue Share: The Complete Model

**Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Purpose:** Clarify ongoing residuals vs one-time fees  
**Critical Decision:** What franchisees pay long-term

---

## The Question You Asked

**"We get the $19k one-time. But do we get ongoing revenue share? Do we have residuals baked in?"**

**Answer: YES. You need residuals. Here's how.**

---

## The Problem with Pure Licensing

I mentioned $19k one-time licensing in the recent document. That's **incomplete.**

Here's why:

```
Model A: Pure One-Time Licensing ($19k only)

Year 1: Franchisee buys license: +$19,000
Year 2-10: Franchisee makes $500k-2M/year, you make: $0
Year 10: Franchisee has made $10M+, you made: $19k total

That's leaving SO much money on the table.
```

**That model is bad because:**
- ❌ You only get paid once
- ❌ Franchisee scales to $2M/year, you get nothing
- ❌ You're incentivized to recruit new franchisees, not support existing ones
- ❌ Franchisees feel like they "won" by paying once

---

## The Winning Model: Tiered Approach

**You should offer TWO options:**

### Option A: Premium License ($19,000 one-time, zero revenue share)

```
For: Franchisees with large operations already
Cost: $19,000 upfront
Ongoing: $0/month
Support: Year 1 only, then basic email

Who chooses this:
- Agency already doing $1M+/year
- Confident they don't need ongoing support
- Want pure ownership with zero other obligations
- Willing to pay more upfront for independence

Your revenue:
- Year 1: $19,000
- Year 2-100: $0
- Total: $19,000 (but your operations profit from ecosystem)
```

### Option B: Growth License ($9,000 one-time + 2% revenue share)

```
For: Franchisees scaling from small to medium
Cost: $9,000 upfront
Ongoing: 2% of gross revenue
Support: Year 1 intensive, Year 2+ ongoing

Who chooses this:
- Growing agencies ($500k-$2M/year currently)
- Want ongoing support as they scale
- Want lower upfront cost
- Happy to share success with you

Your revenue model:
Agency at $500k revenue:
  - Upfront: $9,000
  - Annual: $500k × 2% = $10,000/year
  - Year 1 total: $19,000
  - Year 3 total: $29,000

Agency at $1M revenue:
  - Upfront: $9,000
  - Annual: $1M × 2% = $20,000/year
  - Year 1 total: $29,000
  - Year 3 total: $49,000

Agency at $2M revenue:
  - Upfront: $9,000
  - Annual: $2M × 2% = $40,000/year
  - Year 1 total: $49,000
  - Year 5 total: $89,000
```

### Option C: Partnership License ($5,000 one-time + 3% revenue share)

```
For: New/bootstrap franchisees
Cost: $5,000 upfront
Ongoing: 3% of gross revenue
Support: Year 1 very intensive, ongoing quarterly check-ins

Who chooses this:
- New agency founders
- Want maximum support
- Want lowest upfront cost
- Want ORBIT as partner in growth

Your revenue model:
New agency scaling from scratch:
  - Year 1 (300k revenue): $5k + (300k × 3%) = $14,000
  - Year 2 (800k revenue): $5k + (800k × 3%) = $29,000
  - Year 3 (1.5M revenue): $5k + (1.5M × 3%) = $50,000
  
Total over 3 years: $93,000 (even after lower upfront)
```

## Revenue Share Comparison

### Year 3 Revenue Per Franchisee:

| Option | License | Revenue Share | Partner Level | Total Year 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A (Premium) | $19,000 | $0 | Large | $19,000 |
| B (Growth) | $9,000 | 2% | Medium | $19,000-40,000 |
| C (Partnership) | $5,000 | 3% | Small | $25,000-50,000 |

**Key insight:** Options B and C can generate MORE revenue than Option A once franchisee is scaled.

## The Economics (Why Revenue Share Works)

### Your Direct Operations + Franchisees Combined:

```
Scenario: Year 5 with Mixed Portfolio

Your ORBIT Operations: 100 workers
├─ Revenue: $2.8M
├─ Profit: $1.15M
└─ Your own cash

5 Franchisees on Option A ($19k):
├─ Upfront: $95,000 (one-time)
├─ Total 5-year revenue: $95,000
└─ That's it

10 Franchisees on Option B ($9k + 2%):
├─ Upfront: $90,000
├─ Avg franchisee revenue: $1M
├─ Annual revenue share: 10 × $1M × 2% = $200,000/year
├─ 5-year revenue: $90k + (200k × 5) = $1,090,000
└─ Plus ongoing after Year 5

20 Franchisees on Option C ($5k + 3%):
├─ Upfront: $100,000
├─ Avg franchisee revenue: $800k
├─ Annual revenue share: 20 × $800k × 3% = $480,000/year
├─ 5-year revenue: $100k + (480k × 5) = $2,500,000
└─ Plus ongoing after Year 5

TOTAL:
├─ From direct operations: $1.15M
├─ From licensing: $95,000
├─ From growth partners: $1,090,000
├─ From partnership partners: $2,500,000
├─ TOTAL YEAR 5: $4,835,000 revenue
├─ After 10-person team costs: ~$3M+ profit

That's not licensing a product. That's building an ecosystem.

## Hybrid Model Recommendation

**Here's what I recommend:**

### Tier 1: Subscription (New/Small)
- $500-2,000/month
- For agencies under 100 workers
- No revenue share (already paying monthly)
- Intended to convert to franchise after 18-24 months

### Tier 2: Growth License (Established Medium)
- $9,000 one-time
- 2% revenue share ongoing
- For agencies $500k-$2M revenue
- Heavy support Year 1, ongoing after
- **Your sweet spot** (most franchisees here)

### Tier 3: Premium License (Large/Mature)
- $19,000 one-time
- Zero revenue share
- For agencies $2M+ revenue
- Basic support Year 1+
- They want independence

### Tier 4: Partnership License (Bootstrap)
- $5,000 one-time
- 3% revenue share
- For new founders with hustle, no capital
- Maximum support
- They scale with you

## Why This Model Wins

### For You:
```
✅ Recurring revenue from franchisees
✅ Aligned incentives (you profit when they profit)
✅ Motivation to support franchisees (support = revenue share)
✅ Scalable without adding headcount
✅ Multiple options appeal to different customer segments
✅ Natural upgrade path: Subscription → Partnership → Growth → Premium
```

### For Franchisees:
```
✅ Pay-what-fits options (from $5k to $19k upfront)
✅ Cheaper upfront for early-stage
✅ Share success with ORBIT if desired
✅ Support level matches their needs
✅ Clear upgrade path as they grow
```

### Alignment:
```
ORBIT incentive: Franchisee succeeds → Revenue grows → You profit more
Franchisee incentive: Scale business → Revenue grows → Less relative cost

Example:
Franchisee at $500k revenue:
├─ Option B (2% share): Pays $10k/year in revenue share
├─ As they grow to $2M: Pays $40k/year
├─ Worth it because they're making $1M+ profit/year

You win because:
├─ Started at $9k one-time + $10k/year
├─ Now at $40k/year
├─ Incentive to help them grow (you profit from growth)
```

## Implementation Model

### Revenue Share Calculation:

**What counts as "revenue":**
- ✅ Gross billing to clients (before worker costs)
- ✅ Includes all services, assignments, bonuses
- ❌ NOT worker wages
- ❌ NOT franchisee refunds

**Payment:**
- Quarterly reconciliation (franchisee reports revenue)
- Due 15 days after quarter ends
- Automated billing via dashboard
- Transparent reporting (franchisee can see their calculation)

**Example:**
```
Q1: $250,000 in client billing
Revenue share: $250,000 × 2% = $5,000
Due: 15 days after Q1

Franchisee sees in dashboard:
├─ Q1 Revenue: $250,000
├─ Revenue share (2%): $5,000
├─ Status: Paid ✓
```

## Financial Projections (5 Years with Revenue Share)

### Conservative Scenario:

```
Year 1:
├─ 5 subscriptions at $1,000/month avg = $60,000
├─ 2 franchises (Option C - Partnership): $5k + (avg $300k × 3%) = $28,000
├─ Direct operations: $1,150,000
├─ Total: $1,238,000

Year 2:
├─ 15 subscriptions at $1,200/month avg = $216,000
├─ 5 franchises (2 upgrades from subscription):
│   ├─ 2 on Option C (growing): $100k revenue × 3% = $6,000
│   ├─ 3 new on Option B: (avg $800k × 2%) = $48,000
├─ Direct operations: $1,150,000
├─ Subscription upgrades to franchise: (3 × $9k) = $27,000
├─ Total: $1,447,000

Year 3:
├─ 25 subscriptions at $1,400/month avg = $420,000
├─ 12 franchises:
│   ├─ Growing franchisees revenue share: $180,000
├─ Direct operations: $1,150,000
├─ Subscription conversions: (5 × $9k) = $45,000
├─ Total: $1,795,000

Year 4:
├─ 30 subscriptions: $504,000
├─ 20 franchises revenue share: $420,000
├─ Direct operations: $1,150,000
├─ Subscription conversions: (8 × $9k) = $72,000
├─ Total: $2,146,000

Year 5:
├─ 35 subscriptions: $588,000
├─ 30 franchises revenue share: $720,000
├─ Direct operations: $1,150,000
├─ Subscription conversions: (10 × $9k) = $90,000
├─ Total: $2,548,000

Year 5 Status:
├─ Revenue: $2.548M
├─ Cost (10 person team + infrastructure): $800,000
├─ Profit: $1.748M
├─ From franchises alone: $810,000 (conversions + revenue share)
```

**This is exponential growth with minimal team scaling.**

## Comparison: Revenue Share vs No Revenue Share

### 10-Year Projection:

**No Revenue Share Model:**
```
Year 1: 2 franchises × $19k = $38,000
Year 2: 4 franchises × $19k = $76,000
Year 3: 8 franchises × $19k = $152,000
Year 4: 15 franchises × $19k = $285,000
Year 5: 25 franchises × $19k = $475,000
Year 6-10: (50 total franchises) × $0 = $0 ongoing

Total 10-year licensing revenue: $1,026,000
Average per year: $102,600
```

**With Revenue Share Model (Mixed options):**
```
Year 1: $28,000 (upfront + small share)
Year 2: $270,000 (upfront + growing share)
Year 3: $450,000 (upfront + larger share)
Year 4: $650,000 (upfront + scaling share)
Year 5: $810,000 (upfront + franchise profitability)
Year 6-10: $1M+/year ongoing (just from revenue share)

Total 10-year licensing revenue: $6,500,000+
Average per year: $650,000
```

**Difference: $5.5M more revenue over 10 years**

---

## The Decision: Which Model to Offer?

### My Recommendation:

**Offer all four options, but position differently:**

```
For Sales/Marketing:
├─ "Choose the license tier that fits your business"
├─ Partnership License: "For founders scaling from zero"
├─ Growth License: "For agencies ready to scale"
├─ Premium License: "For mature, multi-region operations"
└─ Subscription: "For bootstrapped founders"

Franchisee customer journey:
Year 0: Subscription ($500/month)
  ↓ After 18 months of success
Year 1.5: Upgrade to Partnership License ($5k + 3%)
  ↓ After 2 years of growth
Year 3: Upgrade to Growth License ($9k + 2%)
  ↓ After 5+ years at scale
Year 5+: Potentially Premium License ($19k one-time)

Your revenue per franchisee:
├─ Subscription phase: $9,000 over 18 months
├─ Partnership phase: $5k + ($500k avg × 3% × 2 years) = $35,000
├─ Growth phase: $9k + ($1.5M avg × 2% × 2 years) = $69,000
├─ TOTAL: $113,000+ per successful franchisee

That's real, recurring revenue.
```

## Next Steps

1. **Decide on revenue share percentages:**
   - Partnership: 3% (aggressive support, new founders)
   - Growth: 2% (standard support, scaling)
   - Premium: 0% (minimal support, mature)

2. **Build revenue tracking:**
   - Franchisee dashboard shows revenue calculated
   - Automated billing for revenue share
   - Transparent reporting

3. **Update marketing:**
   - Pricing page with all four options
   - Comparison table
   - Clear messaging about each tier

4. **Update franchise agreement:**
   - Add revenue share terms
   - Define what counts as "revenue"
   - Payment schedule and terms

---

## Bottom Line

**You absolutely need revenue share.**

Not just one-time licensing fees.

The difference is:
- ❌ No share: Make $19k per franchisee, that's it
- ✅ With share: Make $113k+ per franchisee over time

Plus better alignment: As franchisee succeeds, you profit directly from their success.

That's the difference between licensing software and building an ecosystem.
