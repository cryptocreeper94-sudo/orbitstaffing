## User Preferences
- **Communication:** I prefer clear, concise explanations with minimal jargon.

## System Architecture
The ORBIT Staffing OS is a unified, multi-tenant white-label platform with a three-tier access model: Master Admin, Assigned Admins, and End Users. It utilizes a core ORBIT technology with white-label branding, industry-specific configurations, unified quality, complete data isolation, and scalability. All tangible outputs are stamped with a non-removable "Powered by ORBIT" hallmark for verification.
